# Students_Database_Application
So called "Mini-Project" given by my college.

Friday, 10th December, 2021.
Took me the entire week to finish this.
Run "Main.java". Requirements are Java8 and a pc.

"The App goes hard. Feel free to copy-paste my code."

- Just make sure to give me credits if you wish to use it or parts of it in your own project.
